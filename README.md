LearnR
  •	Worked in a team to develop a new way of learning using augmented reality (AR).
  •	Uses Marker-Based AR detection. The application uses camera of the user to detect certain markers and presents 3D models over the markers when found.
  •	Implemented four modules of learning, English (alphabets), Chemistry (molecules and bonds), Mathematics (shapes) and Biology (Body organs).
  •	Used library AR.js for markers and AR applications, HTML/CSS/JS to make the webpage.
